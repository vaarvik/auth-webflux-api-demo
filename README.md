# An auth demo

## Usage
The API is using httponly cookies which means that the front end only needs to have 'credentials: "include"' in the request to access the API. 
### Example
```
fetch("http://localhost:8080/user/me", {
    credentials: "include",
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    }
}).then(response => response.json())'
```
### Endpoints
Be aware that cors don't allow that many headers and an illegal header will add a OPTIONS request. 
#### Authorization
- http://localhost:8080/auth/signup
- http://localhost:8080/auth/login
- http://localhost:8080/auth/logout
- http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorization/google
- http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorization/google?redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/oauth2/redirect (same as above but redirects to this URI after login attempt)
#### User
- Get user info: http://localhost:8080/user/me
